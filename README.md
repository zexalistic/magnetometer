# magnetometer
This project generates an app on Android device, which can grep the https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3386901.3389030?casa_token=PF2Ay5vp7ScAAAAA%3AeUAWpCq5NPDaCP4RB5kV5kA3jLpzcu8nnd6GOwyDTMs6luQVj0KUkNoHvM1PeTlYdofRdswCYiwHfginformation from its magnetometer and store the information in a data file. 

This app was originally designed for my work, MagHacker: eavesdropping on stylus pen writing via magnetic sensing from commodity mobile devices. However, iPhone's magnetometer is more precise and has higher sample rate, most of my experiment are not based on this app.
